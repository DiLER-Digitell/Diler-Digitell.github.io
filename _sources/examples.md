# Digital Literacy for Empirical Research

-------------------------------------------------

**DiLER or Digital Literacy for Empirical Research aims to provide cost-free, open Educational Resources for students, early-stage researchers, and teaching staff.**

DiLER is a 2022 Partnership of the [Digital Teaching and Learning Lab“ (DigiTeLL)](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/106206707/Projekt_DigiTeLL) hosted by the Goethe-University Frankfurt.

-----------------------------------------------

## Digital Literacy

Students, as well as researchers at all levels, are nowadays necessarily dependent on digital skills & tools to adapt to the rapidly evolving scientific landscape.

We aim to teach these skills through free online resources to bridge the gap between the fortunate few profiting from Academia and lab culture and the general (student) population.

Further, we aim to make our resources as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) as possible. We believe that the work that teaching staff puts into their courses and content should be made available as widely as possible, extending from the university to the people. The courses and course templates provided are built with the idea of sustainability in mind. Through the use of GitHub pages and , markdown files, and Jupyter Books, we provide a permanent, citable online presence for the content we (and maybe you, if you adopt our learning design) create.


-----------------------------------------------

## Resources under the DiLER Project

The DiLER Project has produced several resources for individuals interested in modern and flexible teaching, digital literacy, and scientific research. Our courses are mainly conceptualized as self-paced, self-study resources. If you are interested in adapting some of the content for your own work, are interested in attending workshops on the introduced topics, or would like to contribute to our project, please reach out to us via the information provided at the bottom of this site.
